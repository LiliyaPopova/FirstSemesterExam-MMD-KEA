            <p>
                Hello, I am Liliya. I am a Copenhagen based junior developer in training. I am always curious about the new and developing
                technology landscape. We get to explore the power of innovation every single day. Imagination turns into
                reality, and it brings surprising and exciting change to society. I also love learning how innovation scales
                in technology - from invention all the way to large scale implementation.
            </p>

            <p>
                During my business career in Bulgaria I fortified my knowledge in engineering and mathematics by studying PA systems and pro
                audio products. Understanding the complex software, troubleshooting, and providing solutions opened my eyes
                to a multitude of technologies. In my time in Bulgaria I’ve had the opportunity to lead a new business website
                at work. Whilst designing and managing the implementation phase of the ‘diyparcel website’ project I was
                interacting with web developers every day. I really enjoyed the project and found myself very curious about
                the skills the web developers had. After that, I took an online web development class in Udemy and tried
                to make a website. Coding soon became my new love.
            </p>

            <p>
                I love helping people. I have been organising mentoring sessions by inviting industry mentors and classmates to engage with
                new ideas and skill growth. Wherever I end up, I would like to proactively contribute to creating a thriving
                environment where different skills compliment and benefit each other. I also would like to work on interesting
                projects with like-minded people which provide positive change to society.
            </p>
