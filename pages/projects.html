Following it for 5 days we`ve developed a prototype of an improved ( part of) Fronter - according to the functionality/feature we`ve decided to innovate. Our point of departure was a formulated long term goal and a specific target audience - all decided upon on day one of the design sprint week. The final submission - an XD prototype.We had been working in group of 7 people. The group was working together in different ways during the sprint - and each of the members built individual XD prototypes.

                <span>This was again group project. In it we were again using the Design Sprint method to sole the task that we were working on. Link to XD prototype:</span>
                <ul>

                    <li> So far, we’ve worked on developing a mobile solution of an improved Fronter implementing KEA’s goals and feature wishes. Now we had total freedom as UX designers? We made a native app that equals the Learning Management System of our dreams!</li>
                    <li> The Requirements : The native app has to be native for either an Android or iOS smartphone. With defined long term goals we are aiming for. Work after the Design Sprint concept developing approach. Wore in grop of 7 and you must make them yourselves. The high-fidelity interactive proof of concept prototype is made in Adobe XD.</li>
