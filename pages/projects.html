                <ul>
                    <li> 02.01.05 Treatment - This is the story for your microsite. It must be
                        clear to understand for other professionals. The story must have a beginning, a middle and
                        and end.Consider the dramaturgical model when
                        creating your story. </li>
                    <li> 02.01.07 Storyboard - Before you go out to film, you need to have a
                        storyboard, that will clarify for all group
                        members what images and dramaturgical
                        elements you need in order to tell your story.
                        The storyboard does not have to be perfectly
                        drawn, but it should explain when you have the
                        close ups, medium shots or long shots. This will
                        help you to make sure that even if you can’t get
                        exactly the shots you have planed, you will at
                        least get enough to carry the narrative.</li>

                </ul>
                <span>We`ve experienced working with Design Sprint. Folowing it for 5 days
                    We`ve developed a prototype of an improved ( part of) Fronter - according to the functionality/feature we`ve decided to innovate. Our point of departure was a formulated long term goal and a specific target audience - all decided upon on day one of the design sprint week. The final submission was an XD prototype.
                    We have worked in group of 7 people. The group was working
                    together in different ways during the sprint - and we have built individual XD prototypes.
                    The prototypes are build upon the work and decisions made during the sprint process BUT
                    the XD prototype are made individually and submitted as an individual submission.</span>

                <ul>

                    <li> So far, you’ve worked on developing a mobile solution of an improved Fronter implementing
                        KEA’s goals and feature wishes. But what would happen if you had total freedom as UX designers?
                        What kind of an app would you then make for students at KEA?
                        Make a native app that equals the Learning Management System of your dreams and kicks a**!</li>
                    <li> The Requirements : The native app has to be native for either an Android or iOS smartphone. With defined long term goals we are aiming for. Work after the Design Sprint concept developing approach. Wore in grop of 7 and you must make them yourselves. The high-fidelity interactive proof of concept prototype is made in Adobe XD.</li>
